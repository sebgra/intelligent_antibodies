    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <p>
      Therapeutic (monoclonal) antibodies are one of the most effective therapies available today for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease, lupus and multiple sclerosis. To treat the latter, monoclonal antibodies can target certain proteins involved in these pathologies with a view to neutralizing them, and can also be used to limit the supply of factors essential to tumor growth or disruptors of the tumor microenvironment. Monoclonal antibody-based serotherapy can also compensate for treatment shortfalls in the case of fulminant epidemics where the pathogens involved have a high mutability rate, such as COVID-19.

      Although promising and a major product on the pharmaceutical market, only around thirty monoclonal antibodies are currently available for chronic inflammatory diseases, and around ten for the treatment of cancer. This lack of comprehensiveness is due to the many difficulties inherent in the in-vitro and in-silico design of these therapeutic molecules. Antibody design and/or optimization remains a real challenge, not least because of the need to produce molecules that are effective, target-specific and deliverable to the organs being treated. The difficulties are also linked to long and costly development times.

    <p>
      In order to accelerate the development of therapeutic antibodies, in-silico methods have been developed to reduce modeling times for these molecules, while exploring design possibilities more exhaustively. Although advantageous, these methods currently rely essentially on estimating the affinity between the antibody and its target by calculating the binding energy, which remains difficult to estimate and extremely time-consuming from an experimental point of view.
